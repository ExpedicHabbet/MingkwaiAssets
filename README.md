## What is Mingkwai Typewriter?

Mingkwai Typewriter is invented by Lin Yutang on May 22, 1947. It is 14” (36 cm) wide, 18” (46 cm) deep, 9” (23 cm) tall of slightly bigger than common typewriters. It uses a huge cylinder to store ten thousands of characters, a motor to drive, a character indexing method by looking at the top and bottom with confirming via screen (or “magic eye”). Unfortunately, its mass production isn’t achieved as its sophisticated structure. Now X-PIN and others are reengraving.
